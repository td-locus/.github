### ‚ùìAbout

We, the team **Think-Digital**, are expanding our reach to those who are in need of any guidance to lead a better career.

In a nutshell, Think-Digital is a team founded by the students of SRM University in 2015. The team recruits the interested students over the talented ones to provide collective and personal guidance to develop their skills based on their interest and passion. The team has members right from the first-year freshers to the passed-out alumni who are still in touch shedding their experience upon their loving juniors. The juniors in team TD, get guidance from their seniors and they pass it on to their juniors and those juniors become the next seniors, and the chain is continuing.

We do not assure to provide you with lectures as such, as you will get a lot of it from your college professors. We curate roadmaps on different domains and provide guidance for Self Study. Thus encouraging you to be technical experts on not just what you know, but what you want to know.

This way, we cultivate all the skills required to work in a company, experiencing teamwork right from product development to kickstarting a business, with the management and leadership skills. At this moment of writing, our team is spread across the nation, with 50+ people working in different companies and still staying in touch with our team, providing updates out of their experience on how the industry is transforming.

Our idea is to extend this support for people in need across different colleges and schools. We are currently looking for leads who can take up their initiation to implement this vision in their school/college. Please feel free to refer your friends or cousins who may be in other colleges or schools.
